# Fictional Tea Shop Website Project

Welcome to the Fictional Tea Shop Website project! In this project, I will be creating a captivating website for a tea shop, right on my own computer.

## Project Overview

I've received a comprehensive design specification and a collection of image assets to guide me through the process. The design specification provides a visual representation of a web page, complete with all its CSS properties and values. These specifications are crafted by designers to give developers clear instructions. In this project, I'm confident that I'll be able to skillfully recreate the foundational HTML and CSS elements with minimal assistance.

## Objectives

- Create a fictional tea shop website.
- Utilize the provided design specification and image assets.
- Develop the HTML and CSS components based on the design.
- Achieve a visually appealing and functional website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Follow the design specification and begin crafting the website.
4. Test the website's responsiveness and functionality.
5. Make necessary adjustments and improvements.

## Project Status

Currently, I'm in the process of developing the website's structure and styling based on the design specification. I'm excited to see the project come together and eager to refine it further.
